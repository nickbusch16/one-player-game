// This is a simple game made from the components in the SparkFun Guide to Processing
// Painting program.  You can see the original sketch here: http://bit.ly/1OPoIso
// 
// The goal of this challenge was to create a game from the same components as
// another sketch that have been repurposed.  
//
// 
// I was inspired by this.  I used this authors gameOver idea and brought it 
// into this sketch:
